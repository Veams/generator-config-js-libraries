> Sub-Generator :: Simple JavaScript Libraries Config Generator.

## Sub-Generators in Veams 

Sub-Generators are only responsible to provide prompts and save the answers in a configuration file or in the passed store instance.

Sub-Generators should be used in a composable way, means they are only useful in conjunction with main generators.

## Installation

Be sure you have a main generator in place. Then you can install the generator into that: 

### NPM 

```bash
npm install @veams/generator-config-js-libraries --dev
```

### Yarn 

```bash
yarn add @veams/generator-config-js-libraries
```

## Usage 

Now you can start to work with the sub generator in your main generator. 
This is pretty easy, let's just compose them:

**Main Generator** 

``` js
module.exports = class extends Generator {
	prompting() {
		// Have Yeoman greet the user.
		this.log(`Welcome to the my main generator ${chalk.red('generator-single-page-app')}!`);
	}

	initializing() {
		this.composeWith(require.resolve('generator-config-js-libraries'), {
			__store: this.config,
			availableChoices: ['jquery', 'handlebars']
		});

	}

	configuring() {
		this.config.save();
	}

	writing() {
		this.fs.copyTpl(
			this.templatePath('dummyfile.txt.ejs'),
			this.destinationPath('dummyfile.txt'),
			{
				setup: this.config.getAll()
			}
		);
	}

	install() {
		this.installDependencies();
	}
};

```

You can also see, that we pass the config object (`this.config`) - which is a store instance - from the main generator to the sub generator. 

When the store instance is provided like that (`this.options.__store`), then this sub generator is saving the answers in this store instance.

### Options

* `__store` {Object} [`this.config`] - Store object provided by the main generator.
* `availableChoices` {Array} [all libs] - You can display a specific amount of choices by providing an array of items. The items can be found in the config file of the package. 

### Config File

The config file contains the ids of the libraries you can choose from: 

``` js
module.exports = config = {
	veamsQueryId: '@veams/query',
	jqueryId: 'jquery',
	reactId: 'react',
	reduxId: 'redux',
	rxjsId: 'rxjs',
	handlebarsId: 'handlebars'
};
```
